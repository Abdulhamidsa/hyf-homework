            Another wierd hobbies that I have , is the enjoyment of disassembling every electrical tool i see , like realy anything , an old Tv , old laptop , and even if it's new , i really feel exited doing this , I have alot of curiosity to know how these tools works , and if there is something was broken and i managed to fix it , I feel SO HAPPY , it feels like i won a lottery ! .</p>
